# SW-TRANCIA-USB

PLC program for controlling a machine for cutting plastic parts. Arduino software was used to write the PLC program, and Ethernet PLC (M-duino) https://www.industrialshields.com/shop/category/controllers-cpu-ios-com-plc-ethernet-controller-family-ethernet-plc-m-duino-1
was used as hardware.

The tablet and uPanel application (http://www.miupanel.com/) were used as the HMI panel, which communicates with the PLC device via a WiFi network.

I have realized about 20 similar projects.
